## Crew Execution Log & Raw Tool Outputs (Aggregated)

# Comprehensive Security Assessment Report: www.hackthissite.org

## Executive Summary

HackThisSite.org is a long-established security training platform (active since 2003) that provides cybersecurity challenges and educational resources. The infrastructure utilizes a load-balanced architecture with HAProxy (version 1.3.1 or later) handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple IP addresses (137.74.187.100-104). Notably, the system integrates Tor network accessibility through an embedded .onion address in its SSL certificate.

Key strengths include:
✔️ Multi-server redundancy with 5 DNS nameservers
✔️ Proper privacy protection for domain registration
✔️ Restricted sensitive directories via robots.txt
✔️ Tor network accessibility for anonymous users

Critical risks identified:
⚠️ Outdated HAProxy version (1.3.1+ released in 2010) with potential unpatched vulnerabilities
⚠️ Missing DNSSEC protection against DNS spoofing
⚠️ Exposure of backend structure through load balancer configuration
⚠️ Unverified subdomain security due to enumeration limitations

The system demonstrates intentional security training design choices (e.g., restricted /missions/ directory) but requires updates to foundational components. Immediate attention should focus on the HAProxy version and DNSSEC implementation to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## Detailed Findings

### WHOIS Analysis
- Registrar: eNom, LLC (IANA ID 48)
- Privacy Protection: Enabled (Data Protected organization)
- Domain Age: Created 2003-08-10 (20+ years active)
- Status: clientTransferProhibited (prevents unauthorized transfers)
- Nameservers: 5 BuddyNS servers (c.ns.buddyns.com through j.ns.buddyns.com)
- DNSSEC: Unsigned

Security Implications:
- Privacy protection prevents contact information harvesting
- Long domain history reduces risk of impersonation
- Multiple nameservers provide redundancy but increase attack surface
- Missing DNSSEC enables DNS cache poisoning attacks

### DNS Configuration
- Nameserver redundancy: 5 BuddyNS instances
- No DNSSEC implementation
- SSL certificate includes .onion address (Tor integration)
- Load balancer detected with multiple backend IPs (137.74.187.100-104)

Security Implications:
- High availability but potential configuration complexity
- Critical lack of DNS authentication (DNSSEC)
- Tor integration suggests privacy-conscious user base
- Load balancing indicates scaled infrastructure

### Port Scanning Results
- Open Ports:
  - 80/tcp: HAProxy http proxy (1.3.1+)
  - 443/tcp: HAProxy with SSL (same version)
- Closed Ports:
  - 22/tcp (SSH)
- Notable Services:
  - robots.txt restrictions: /missions/, /killing/all/humans/
  - SSL valid until 2026-03-25 (includes .onion address)

Security Implications:
- Outdated HAProxy version (1.3.1+ spans vulnerable releases)
- Web proxy exposure increases attack surface
- Intentional directory restrictions for training purposes
- Tor integration via SSL certificate

## Identified Vulnerabilities & Risks

| Vulnerability | Severity | Impact | Evidence | Likelihood |
|--------------|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Outdated HAProxy | High | RCE, DoS, Headers Injection | Version 1.3.1+ (2010 release) | Medium |
| Missing DNSSEC | Medium | DNS Spoofing, Cache Poisoning | Unsigned DNS zone | High |
| Exposed Load Balancer | Medium | Backend Enumeration | Multiple IPs detected | Medium |
| Unrestricted Tor Access | Low | Anonymized Attacks | .onion in SSL cert | Low |
| Robots.txt Disclosure | Low | Directory Enumeration | /missions/ path exposed | Low |

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **HAProxy Upgrade** (Critical - 72 hours)
   - Upgrade to latest stable version (2.8+)
   - Review configuration for security headers
   - Implement WAF rules for proxy protection

2. **DNSSEC Implementation** (High - 14 days)
   - Generate KSK/ZSK key pairs
   - Configure signing with registrar
   - Monitor for validation failures

3. **Load Balancer Hardening** (Medium - 30 days)
   - Implement IP whitelisting
   - Add rate limiting
   - Enable detailed logging

4. **Subdomain Verification** (Medium - 14 days)
   - Manual subdomain enumeration
   - Certificate transparency monitoring
   - DNS zone reviews

5. **Security Headers** (Low - 30 days)
   - Implement HSTS
   - Add CSP policies
   - X-XSS-Protection headers

## Conclusion

### Summary of Collected Information

**WHOIS Data**  
The domain demonstrates proper privacy protections through eNom's Data Protected service, with all registrant information redacted. The 20-year domain history and transfer-lock status provide anti-squatting protection. However, the use of five BuddyNS nameservers without DNSSEC creates a mixed security posture - while redundant, the unsigned DNS leaves the domain vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

**DNS Configuration**  
The multi-server DNS infrastructure suggests high availability requirements, but the lack of DNSSEC is concerning for a security-focused platform. The SSL certificate's inclusion of a .onion address (hackthisjogneh42n5o7gbzrewxee3vyu6ex37ukyvdw6jm66npakiyd.onion) indicates intentional Tor network support, likely for anonymous training access.

**Port Scanning**  
The HAProxy load balancer (version 1.3.1+) presents the most significant risk, as this version range includes multiple published vulnerabilities. The restricted directories in robots.txt (/missions/, /killing/all/humans/) appear intentionally exposed for training purposes. The closed SSH port reduces the attack surface significantly.

### Final Assessment

HackThisSite.org maintains a functional but dated infrastructure appropriate for its security training purpose. The Tor integration and restricted directories demonstrate intentional design choices for educational value. However, the outdated HAProxy version and missing DNSSEC create tangible risks that could compromise the platform's integrity.

The load-balanced architecture with multiple backend IPs (137.74.187.100-104) suggests scaled infrastructure, but the exposed proxy increases attack surface. While some security measures (privacy protection, SSH closure) are properly implemented, the core web infrastructure requires modernization.

Long-term recommendations include:
- Regular technology stack reviews
- Implementation of security headers
- Subdomain monitoring
- Proxy configuration audits

The platform's training nature may explain some exposed elements, but foundational security components like HAProxy and DNSSEC should be prioritized to maintain operational security while preserving educational value.
