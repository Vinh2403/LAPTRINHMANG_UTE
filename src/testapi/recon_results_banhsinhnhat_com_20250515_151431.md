**A Record:**
- banhsinhnhat.com: 194.233.91.24

**MX Records:**
- Google Workspace (aspmx.l.google.com and alternates)

**TXT Records:**
- Google site verification only
- Missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC

**Risk Assessment:** High (Missing email security controls)

### 3. Subdomain Enumeration
**Discovered Subdomains:**

**Risk Assessment:** Unknown (Limited by service blocks)

### 4. Port Scanning
**Open Ports:**
- 22/tcp: OpenSSH 8.7
- 80/tcp: nginx (redirects to HTTPS)
- 443/tcp: nginx with valid SSL cert

**SSL Certificate Details:**
- Valid: 2025-05-13 to 2025-08-11
- SANs: *.banhsinhnhat.com, banhsinhnhat.com

**Risk Assessment:**
- Medium (Exposed services with no critical vulnerabilities)

### 5. Technology Stack
**Identified Components:**
- Frontend: nginx web server
- Hosting: Cloudflare-protected
- Email: Google Workspace

**Undetermined Components:**
- CMS/Framework (scan failed)
- Backend technologies

**Risk Assessment:** Unknown (Incomplete data)

### 6. Directory Enumeration
**Results:**
- All attempts timed out
- Possible rate-limiting or filtering

**Risk Assessment:** Unknown (Scan prevented)

## Data Correlations

1. **Subdomain & Port Scan:**
   - Wildcard SSL (*.banhsinhnhat.com) suggests potential undiscovered subdomains
   - Recommend focused scans on common subdomains (admin, dev, api)

2. **DNS & Email Security:**
   - Google MX records without SPF/DKIM/DMARC creates email spoofing risk
   - Critical need for email authentication records

3. **Port Scan & Technology:**
   - nginx on 443 suggests web application exists
   - Need for deeper web app assessment

## Risk Prioritization Matrix

| Risk Item                  | Level   | Justification                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Email Security     | High    | No SPF/DKIM/DMARC allows email spoofing and phishing                          |
| Exposed SSH Service        | Medium  | OpenSSH 8.7 has no known critical vulnerabilities but provides attack surface |
| Web Server Exposure        | Medium  | nginx exposed with valid cert but unknown application risks                   |
| DNSSEC Missing             | Low     | Cloudflare protection mitigates some DNS risks                                |
| WHOIS Privacy              | Low     | Proper protection in place                                                    |
| Undiscovered Subdomains    | Unknown | Limited scan results                                                          |
| Web Directory Visibility   | Unknown | Scanning prevented                                                            |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority):
1. **Implement Email Security:**
   - Add SPF record to authorize Google mail servers
   - Configure DKIM for email authentication
   - Implement DMARC policy (start with p=none)

2. **Secure SSH Access:**
   - Implement key-based authentication
   - Consider restricting access to known IP ranges
   - Monitor for brute force attempts

### Medium-Term Actions:
3. **Web Application Security:**
   - Perform manual inspection of common admin paths
   - Conduct authorized vulnerability scanning
   - Implement WAF rules in Cloudflare

4. **DNS Enhancements:**
   - Enable DNSSEC for additional DNS security
   - Monitor for DNS changes

### Investigation Needed:
5. **Subdomain Discovery:**
   - Retry with alternative tools (Amass, Fierce)
   - Use VPN/proxy rotation to avoid blocks
   - Brute-force with common subdomain wordlists

6. **Directory Enumeration:**
   - Coordinate with site owner for authorized testing
   - Try manual inspection of common paths
   - Use alternative scanning IP addresses

## Retry Suggestions

### For Failed Subdomain Enumeration:
```bash
amass enum -passive -d banhsinhnhat.com
fierce --domain banhsinhnhat.com --delay 1000
```

### For Directory Enumeration:
```bash
# With increased delays
dirsearch -u https://banhsinhnhat.com -t 2 --delay=1000
# Alternative tool
gobuster dir -u https://banhsinhnhat.com -w common.txt -t 3 -k
```

### For Technology Identification:
```bash
# Manual inspection
curl -I https://banhsinhnhat.com
# Browser inspection
Install Wappalyzer browser extension
```

## Conclusion

The banhsinhnhat.com domain shows proper basic security measures with Cloudflare protection and WHOIS privacy, but has critical gaps in email security. The inability to complete web application scanning leaves unknown risks that require further investigation. Immediate focus should be on implementing email authentication controls while coordinating for more comprehensive web application testing.
