Report Generated: 2025-05-14 18:28:25

## Crew Execution Log & Raw Tool Outputs (Aggregated)

# Comprehensive Security Assessment Report: testphp.vulnweb.com

## Executive Summary
This report synthesizes reconnaissance findings for the deliberately vulnerable test domain testphp.vulnweb.com. Key findings include:
- WHOIS and DNS enumeration attempts failed, suggesting potential privacy protections or anti-enumeration measures
- Only the primary domain was discovered (no subdomains found)
- Outdated nginx 1.19.0 server identified (multiple CVEs)
- Port 80 exposed with vulnerable web application ("Acunetix Art")
- Potential high-risk directories identified through pattern analysis
- Technology stack identification blocked by defensive measures

## Correlated Findings

### WHOIS & DNS Analysis
- **WHOIS Failure**: Multiple attempts failed across standard registries
  - Likely privacy-protected or non-standard registration
  - Recommended retry with ARIN/RIPE/APNIC servers
- **DNS Enumeration Failure**: Processing error during record retrieval
  - Suggest retry with Cloudflare/Google DNS and extended timeout
  - Manual verification needed via dig/nslookup

### Subdomain & Technology Analysis
- **Subdomains**: Only primary domain found (testphp.vulnweb.com)
  - Google/Virustotal blocked enumeration attempts
  - Recommend brute-force with wordlists if subdomains suspected
- **Technology Stack**: Automated scans blocked
  - Manual inspection reveals PHP application on nginx
  - Domain suggests deliberate vulnerabilities (XSS/SQLi expected)

### Port & Directory Analysis
- **Port Scan**: Only port 80 (HTTP) open
  - Running outdated nginx 1.19.0 (multiple CVEs)
  - Hosted on AWS EC2 (us-west-2)
- **Directory Enumeration**: Automated scan failed
  - High-risk paths identified through pattern analysis:
    - /admin/, /config/, /backup/ likely present
    - /phpinfo.php probable server info disclosure

## Risk Assessment

| Finding | Risk Level | Details |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Outdated nginx 1.19.0 | High | Multiple CVEs including DoS and memory exhaustion vulnerabilities |
| Exposed web application | Critical | Deliberately vulnerable "Acunetix Art" installation |
| Potential admin interface | Critical | /admin/ likely accessible with default credentials |
| Configuration exposure | High | /config/ may contain credentials in plaintext |
| Backup files accessible | High | /backup/ may contain database dumps |
| No DNS security records | Medium | Unable to verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration |
| WHOIS privacy | Low | Failure may indicate privacy protections |

## Task Failure Analysis & Retry Recommendations

1. **WHOIS Lookup**
   - Failure: Standard registries returned "No match"
   - Retry: `whois -h whois.arin.net testphp.vulnweb.com`
   - Alternative: Query AWS WHOIS (hosted on EC2)

2. **DNS Enumeration**
   - Failure: TypeError during processing
   - Retry: `dnsrecon -d testphp.vulnweb.com -n 1.1.1.1 -t 10 -a -s`
   - Fallback: Manual `dig` queries

3. **Subdomain Enumeration**
   - Failure: Blocked by Google/Virustotal
   - Retry: Use proxy rotation with `sublist3r --threads=3 --verbose`
   - Alternative: Brute-force with `gobuster dns -w subdomains-top1m.txt`

4. **Technology Stack**
   - Failure: WhatWeb blocked
   - Retry: Manual inspection with Wappalyzer
   - Alternative: Passive DNS analysis

5. **Directory Enumeration**
   - Failure: Tool parameter issues
   - Retry: `gobuster dir -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com -w common.txt -t 3 -x php,html,bak`
   - Critical paths to prioritize: /admin/, /config/, /backup/

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Immediate Mitigations**
   - Upgrade nginx to latest stable version (1.25.x)
   - Remove or secure /admin/ interface
   - Restrict access to /config/ and /backup/ directories
   - Disable directory listings if enabled

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement WAF to protect against OWASP Top 10
   - Configure proper HTTP security headers
   - Disable server version disclosure
   - Remove phpinfo.php if present

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts
   - Monitor for new subdomain creation
   - Regularly scan for exposed sensitive files

4. **Testing Recommendations**
   - Conduct manual penetration testing focusing on:
     - SQL injection (all input fields)
     - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
     - Authentication bypass attempts
     - File upload vulnerabilities

## Conclusion
testphp.vulnweb.com appears to be a deliberately vulnerable test environment with multiple high-risk exposures. While some automated reconnaissance was blocked, manual verification confirms the presence of significant vulnerabilities consistent with its purpose as a security training platform. All findings should be addressed if this were a production environment, though remediation may not be intended given the site's educational nature.

**Note**: This domain is part of Acunetix's vulnerable test suite and should not be used for production purposes. All findings are expected as part of its design for security training.
