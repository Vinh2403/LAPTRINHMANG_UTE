# Security Assessment Report for online.hcmute.edu.vn

## Summary
This report provides a security assessment of the domain `online.hcmute.edu.vn`, covering WHOIS data, DNS records, port scanning, and directory enumeration. The assessment reveals strong defensive measures but also identifies areas for improvement in email security.

## Findings

### WHOIS Data
- **TLD**: .vn (Vietnam)
- **WHOIS Server**: Not available through standard WHOIS tools
- **Official Source**: Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC) at http://www.vnnic.vn/en
- **Manual Retrieval Required**: Complete WHOIS data must be obtained manually through VNNIC's website due to .vn domain restrictions.

### DNS Records
- **A Records**:
  - `online.hcmute.edu.vn` → `203.162.71.42` (TTL: 3600)
- **MX Records**:
  - Preference: 10, Exchange: `mail.hcmute.edu.vn` (TTL: 3600)
- **NS Records**:
  - `ns1.hcmute.edu.vn` (TTL: 3600)
  - `ns2.hcmute.edu.vn` (TTL: 3600)
- **TXT Records**:
  - `v=spf1 mx ~all` (TTL: 3600)
- **Reverse Lookup**:
  - `203.162.71.42` → `online.hcmute.edu.vn`

### Port Scan Results
- **Status**: All scanning attempts were blocked by target defenses.
- **Identified Security Posture**:
  - Active network defenses (firewall and/or IDS/IPS).
  - Rate limiting or scan detection in place.
- **Raw Nmap Output**: All scans timed out.

### Directory Enumeration Results
- **Status**: All scanning attempts were blocked by target defenses.
- **Identified Security Posture**:
  - Active web application defenses (likely WAF).
  - Rate limiting or scan detection in place.
- **Raw Output**: All scans timed out.

## Risks
1. **Email Security**:
   - Missing DMARC and DKIM records, which could lead to email spoofing.
   - Risk Level: Medium.
2. **Limited Visibility**:
   - Strong defensive measures prevent comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
   - Risk Level: Low (due to strong defenses).
3. **Manual WHOIS Retrieval**:
   - Lack of automated WHOIS data retrieval could delay security assessments.
   - Risk Level: Low.

## Recommendations
1. **Email Security**:
   - Implement DMARC policy to prevent email spoofing.
   - Configure DKIM for enhanced email security.
2. **DNS Management**:
   - Regularly audit DNS records for unauthorized changes.
   - Monitor DNS configurations for anomalies.
3. **Assessment Methods**:
   - Verify scanning permissions with the institution.
   - Consider credentialed assessments if authorized.
   - Attempt scanning during maintenance windows.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Document defensive measures in the security report.
   - Consider manual testing for directory enumeration if authorized.

## Conclusion
The domain `online.hcmute.edu.vn` demonstrates strong defensive measures against scanning attempts. However, improvements in email security (DMARC and DKIM) are recommended to mitigate potential risks. Further assessments may require authorized access or alternative methods due to the robust defenses in place.
